# To Do List
As you can see in the following code files, I have created a to-do list both to learn the basic fundamentals of javascript (eg responding to form events, using css in a practical environment, and 
to explore common dom methods and functions) and to gain an insight into the programming process (How do people come up with features to respond to such a common need, and how are they implemented).

Here are some images of the final product:
